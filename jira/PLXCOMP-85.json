However, I have heard about use-cases where users employ a flat directory structure for their source files but still have a deep directory structure for the target directory. This might happen in the domain of code generators (e.g. JavaCC or JFlex) where the source (grammar) files are stored in a single directory (some people hesitate to setup a deep directory structure for one or two files). The actual output directory for a generated file is determined by extracting further information (e.g. package declaration) from the processed input file. MJAVACC-30 is a more specific example of this problem.\n\nTo properly deal with such non-trivial directory mappings, it would be helpful if the SourceMapping interface would be extended like this:\n{code:java}\nSet getTargetFiles( File targetDir, File sourceDir, String source )\n{code}\nFeeding the source directory into the mapping would allow for specialized implementations of the interface that can reconstruct the full path to the source file, open and analyze it and determine the corresponding target file.","priority":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"http://jira.codehaus.org/images/icons/priorities/minor.png","name":"Minor","id":"4"},"duedate":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"29245","self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/issueLink/29245","type":{"id":"10010","name":"Related","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10010"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"57597","key":"MJAVACC-30","self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/issue/57597","fields":{"summary":"Use generated Java files themselves for stale source detection","status":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
