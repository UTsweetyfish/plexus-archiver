My initial assumption was that the behaviour was something like this:\n\n(1) If the value of lastUpdatedWithinMsecs is 0, the target file will only be selected when the source file is newer (this is how it works now).\n(2) If the value of lastUpdatedWithinMsecs is > 0, for example 100, the target will be selected if the value of lastUpdatedWithinMsecs has passed since the lastModified date.  In other words target was last modified 100 ms ago (this part is not how it works now).\n\nAfter looking at the code, the second part (2) actually works like this:\nWhen lastUpdatedWithinMsecs is > 0, for example 100, then the target must be 100 ms or more older than the source in order to be selected.\n\nEither way could be correct depending on what was the intention when this code was written.  I attached a patched that changes the scanner to work the first way.\n\nIf it is correct as is, then you can ignore the patch, but it would be nice to just have some javadoc comments in the file that describe how it behaves.\n","priority":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"http://jira.codehaus.org/images/icons/priorities/minor.png","name":"Minor","id":"4"},"duedate":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10163":"218851200","watches":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/issue/PLXCOMP-95/watchers","watchCount":0,"isWatching":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"subtasks":[],"status":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"http://jira.codehaus.org/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1"},"customfield_10090":null,"labels":[],"workratio":-1,"assignee":null,"attachment":[{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/attachment/32437","id":"32437","filename":"plexus-compiler-api-StaleSource-r7194.patch","author":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/user?username=pgier","name":"pgier","emailAddress":"pgier@redhat.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10232","24x24":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10232","32x32":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10232","48x48":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10232"},"displayName":"Paul Gier","active":true},"created":"2008-02-07T15:05:50.666-0600","size":1168,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/attachment/32437/plexus-compiler-api-StaleSource-r7194.patch"}],"customfield_10221":null,"customfield_10220":null,"customfield_10200":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_10190":null,"project":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/project/11440","id":"11440","key":"PLXCOMP","name":"Plexus Components","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=11440&avatarId=10011","24x24":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=11440&avatarId=10011","32x32":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=11440&avatarId=10011","48x48":"http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/projectavatar?pid=11440&avatarId=10011"},"projectCategory":{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10003","id":"10003","description":"various containers","name":"containers"}},"versions":[],"customfield_10170":[{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10070","value":"Yes","id":"10070"}],"environment":null,"timeestimate":null,"customfield_10130":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"lastViewed":null,"components":[{"self":"http://jira.codehaus.org/rest/api/2/component/12541","id":"12541","name":"plexus-compiler"}],"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":0,"total":0,"comments":[]},"timeoriginalestimate":null,"aggregatetimespent":null}}
